Learn how during a week this summer at the lovely University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison Applications are now open! See below for details. During the School, July 25\u201329, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems \u2014 at your own campus or using the national-scale OSG \u2014 to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today\u2019s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and lots of hands-on activities with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help. The school is ideal for graduate students in any research area for which large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process, plus we welcome applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students, faculty, and staff (especially staff who perform research or support/facilitate researchers). People accepted to this program will receive financial support for basic travel and local costs associated with the School. Applications \u00b6 Applications are now open. The deadline for applications is Monday, 18 April 2022. Submit your application soon to ensure consideration! To apply, complete both of the steps below (in parallel, if you like): Complete the online application form (the link goes to a Qualtrics survey, which is the application) Have someone email a letter of recommendation for you to user-school@opensciencegrid.org (any reasonable format is fine; we like PDF or plain text best) For the letter of recommendation, ask someone who knows you professionally \u2014 ideally a faculty member or other supervisor. They should clearly identify your name and the \u201cOSG User School 2022\u201d in the subject line and letter, so that we can associate your application and letter. Ideal candidates will: Be graduate students doing research or support staff helping researchers (but see below) Need large amounts of computing, which could transform research or open new paths to discovery Have basic experience with the Linux command line (or learn beforehand) Be available to travel to Madison for the School dates (foreign students, check your passport and visa now!) Not a graduate student or support staff? We consider applications from advanced undergraduates, especially those who are involved in graduate-level research or coursework; tell us what you have done! Also, we consider members of other groups (post-doctoral students, faculty, researchers, other staff, etc.), especially if this opportunity is likely to have a significant effect on your work or research or that of others. Contact Us \u00b6 The OSG User School is part of the OSG Outreach Area \u2014 please visit that site to learn about other OSG Outreach activities.
