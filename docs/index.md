<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing?</p>

*Learn how during a week this summer at the lovely [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://wisc.edu/)*

<p style="color: #FF6600; font-weight: bold;">Applications are now open! <a href="#applications">See below</a> for details.</p>

During the School,
July 25–29,
you will learn to use [high-throughput computing](https://htcondor.org/htc.html) (HTC) systems —
at your own campus or using the national-scale [OSG](https://osg-htc.org/) —
to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science.

Through lectures, discussions, and **lots of hands-on activities** with experienced OSG staff,
you will learn how HTC systems work,
how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow,
and where to turn for more information and help.

The school is ideal for graduate students in any research area
for which large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process,
plus we welcome applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students, faculty, and staff
(especially staff who perform research or support/facilitate researchers).

People accepted to this program will receive financial support for
basic travel and local costs associated with the School.

## Applications

Applications are now open.
**The deadline for applications is Monday, 18 April 2022.**
Submit your application soon to ensure consideration!

To apply, complete both of the steps below (in parallel, if you like):

* Complete the [online application form](https://uwmadison.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bdBbGikmcgabwGO)
  (the link goes to a Qualtrics survey, which is the application)

* Have someone email a letter of recommendation for you to
  [user-school@opensciencegrid.org](mailto:user-school@opensciencegrid.org)
  (any reasonable format is fine; we like PDF or plain text best)

For the letter of recommendation, ask someone who knows you professionally&nbsp;&mdash;
ideally a faculty member or other supervisor.
They should clearly identify your name and the “OSG User School 2022” in the subject line and letter,
so that we can associate your application and letter.

Ideal candidates will:

*   Be graduate students doing research or support staff helping researchers (but see below)
*   Need large amounts of computing, which could transform research or open new paths to discovery
*   Have basic experience with the Linux command line (or learn beforehand)
*   Be available to travel to Madison for the School dates (foreign students, check your passport and visa now!)

**Not a graduate student or support staff?**
We consider applications from advanced undergraduates,
especially those who are involved in graduate-level research or coursework;
tell us what you have done!
Also, we consider members of other groups
(post-doctoral students, faculty, researchers, other staff, etc.),
especially if this opportunity is likely to have a significant effect on your work or research or that of others.
