### Travel Between the Madison Airport and Your Hotel

Both [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/) and [Uber](https://www.uber.com/ride/) are active in Madison,
or you can choose from our local taxi companies, including [Green Cab](https://greencabmadison.com), and
[Union Cab](https://www.unioncab.com/).

Taxis are readily available at the Madison airport, but nearly everywhere else (e.g., from your
hotel back to the airport), you should contact the company and request a ride or
make a reservation in advance.  

Additionally, Madison Metro's #20 bus runs every half-hour from 6am to 10pm weekdays and connects 
with the north transfer point where you can find buses serving the campus area.

### Walking

It is easy to walk in and around the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison
campus with many Madison landmarks within a mile of the school and your hotel.
Use a mapping app or ask us or your hotel for a map.  In particular,
State Street&nbsp;&mdash; which connects the Capitol Square with the UW
campus&nbsp;&mdash; is full of great shops and restaurants and is worth
strolling along while you are here.
