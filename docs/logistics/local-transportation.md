coordinate and can reimburse costs between the airport and your hotel.

### Travel Between the Madison Airport and Your Hotel

Both [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/) and [Uber](https://www.uber.com/ride/) are active in Madison,

Taxis are readily available at the Madison airport, but nearly everywhere else (e.g., from your
hotel back to the airport), you should contact the company and request a ride or
make a reservation in advance.  

Additionally, Madison Metro's #20 bus runs every half-hour from 6am to 10pm weekdays and connects 
with the north transfer point where you can find buses serving the campus area.

It is easy to walk in and around the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison
campus with many Madison landmarks within a mile of the School and your hotel.

State Street&nbsp;&mdash; which connects the Capitol Square with the UW
campus&nbsp;&mdash; is full of great shops and restaurants and is worth
strolling along while you are here.
